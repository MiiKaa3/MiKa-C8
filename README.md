# MiKa-C8
A CHIP-8 Emulator and Assembler CLI tool I made ALL BY MYSELF. For real, I'm going to see how far I can go without any tutorial or outside help. I'll add any resources that I did use to the README here.

I'll add graphics support using SDL2. But for now, I'm planning on using the opcodes `00E0` and `DXYN` to interact with stdout. Maybe I'll even add an initialisation byte that allows the user to specify if they want graphical or terminal display.
